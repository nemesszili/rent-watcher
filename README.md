rent-watcher
============

Small scraper that looks for a place to rent

Given a set of start_urls and parse rules, the scraper checks the given sites for new entries, updating the zeh_report.html file if said new entries are found. The script also handles pagination. GUI alerts are provided via zenity.

Why? Because looking for rent is (still) a major pain in the ass.
